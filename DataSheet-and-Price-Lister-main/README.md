# DataSheet-and-Price-Lister
These Python scripts automate fetching Siemens and Schneider Electric product prices and datasheets. The first retrieves Siemens prices, saving them to a CSV. The second downloads Schneider datasheets from regional URLs, while the third targets Siemens datasheets, using cookies for authenticated access and retrying on failures.
